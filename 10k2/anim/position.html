    <p class="san">About 50 million years ago the vast tectonic plate we now know as the subcontinent of India crashed
         into Asia and produced the world’s largest mountain range, the Himalayas – “the abode of snow”
          in Sanskrit – which separates the Tibetan Plateau from the Indian subcontinent. The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region extends 3,500 km over all or part of eight countries from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east, 
        affecting air and water circulation systems, and impacting the weather conditions in the region. \
        Today it is the source of ten large Asian river systems – the Amu Darya, Indus, Ganges, 
        Brahmaputra (Yarlung Tsangpo), Irrawaddy, Salween (Nu), Mekong (Lancang), Yangtse (Jinsha), Yellow River 
        (Huanghe), and Tarim (Dayan). Drawing warm air from the south, which cooled and precipitated as torrential rainfall, the Himalayas created the monsoons and a fertile area in the Northwest that may well be “the land of seven rivers” described in the Vedas.

        Between 7000 and 5000 BCE, pastoral camps and the first village farming communities settled into
         this fertile region. Over millennia these communities developed and interacted with others, sharing skills and technologies such as pottery, metallurgy, town planning and farming. Hence, by 2500 BCE the region became the largest, if not the greatest civilization of the Ancient world, expanding over one million square 
         kilometers in its mature (Integration) phase with an estimated population of five million people.
        Known as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, its zenith lasted about thirteen centuries and 
        flourished in the basins of the Indus River, one of the major rivers of Asia, and the Sarasvati
         or Ghaggar-Hakra River, which once flowed through northwest India and eastern Pakistan.
          The majority of the discovered sites are located either along these major rivers and their 
          tributaries or along trade routes linking larger urban centers.
          Iran, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent had engaged in seasonal migration and trade for
           hundreds of years, so the people of the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization already had long-standing 
           connections with regions to their West. They also established links with Gulf Coast cultures
            reaching all the way to southern Mesopotamia and, via intermediaries such as Bahrain’s Dilmun 
            traders, far beyond. They exported gold, copper, timber, ivory and cotton to Mesopotamia and 
            
            imported bronze, tin, silver, lapis lazuli, and soapstone. To maintain such an extensive 
            trade network they must have possessed advanced skills in ship building, sailing and overland 
            transportation.

“For navigation, compasses carved out of conch shells appear to have been used to measure angles between 
stars. A voyage from Lothal to Mesopotamia to sell the prized Harappan carnelian beads, which the kings 

and queens of Ur were so fond of, meant at least 2,500 kilometres of seafaring; of course there would have
 been halts along the shore on the way, but still, 4,500 years ago this must have ranked among the best 
 sailing abilities,” says Michel Danino, IIT-Madras.
